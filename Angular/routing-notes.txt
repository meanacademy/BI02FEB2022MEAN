To crate a routing application 
    ng new appname

    here it will ask you a question regarding to routing
    enter 'y' and hit enter button 


Routing in Angular
    - with routing we can mange routes or paths of an application
    - with routing we can navigate to each component with unique url or path
    - angular comes with 'Router' module 
    - we can find router module in '@angular/router package'
    - make routes for component
    - getting parameters from routes
    - loading child routes
    - lazy loading
    - handiling wild cards (Dynamic navigation)
    - handling default route
    - handling 404 page

    routes 
        http://localhost:4200/

        '/' - root path

        http://localhost:4200/products
        http://localhost:4200/products/product-a/

        http://localhost:4200/products/product-a/123/


    Angular Routing Module provides routes array
        routes array will be useful for defining the paths for our components
    
    Routing Module
        routing module is a placeholder for configuring all the routes and navigation in one module

        crete a routing module file in existing project
            ng g m app-routing --module = app
   
    Child Routes
    user
        myorders
        profile
            change password
            update email
            update mob
        setting
        security


        { 
            path: "user", 
            component: UserComponent,
            children:[
                {
                    path: 'profile',
                    component: ProfileComponent,
                    children: [
                        path: 'changepassword',
                        component: ChangePasswordComponent
                    ]
                },
                {
                    path: 'setting',
                    component: SettingComponent
                }
            ]
        }

    Angular lazy Loading
        - By default, NgModules are eagerly loaded
        - eagerly loaded means we are calling all the modules(NgModules) as our application loades on browser
        - If you are working on large scale applications, it will reduce the performance of an application or make a load on application
        - For large applications we have to use Lazy Loading because we multiple or large amount of routes there
        - 'Lazy Loading' is a design pattern that loads NgModules as per the need or requirement.
        - also 'lazy loading' helps to decrese the load time `

        Syntax:
        ng g module moduleName --route routename --module parentmodulename

        ex.:
        ng g module employees --route employee --module app.module

    Route Guards:
         it helps to prevent users to navigate any route or path of a application withouted authentication or authorization

         generate route guard with cli`

         ng g guard guardName

         ex.: ng g guard auth

        guard interfaces
        1. CanActivate
            it authenticate user to visit a route or not
        2. CanDeactivate
            it checks if user can exit the route
        3. CanActivateChild
            it will check if user can visit to child or not
        4. CanLoad
            it will check if user can visit to lazy loaded module
        5. Relove
            retruns all the data (route data) before route activation


Assignment on Routing:
    1. create a routing for colleege with its child (upto 5 children)
    2. create a lazy loaded module for route user
    3. create guard for any route that you have created in assignment 1
