Types of Angular Forms
    1. Template Driven Form (TDF)
    2. Reactive Form (Dynamic Form)

With angular framework we can do with forms as
    two way data binding
    change tracking 
    validations
    error handling

TDF 
    they are easy to use and implement
    they are straightforward and simple
    the validations can be done or defined in template file (html)
    to use TDF we need to import 'FormsModule' in app.module.ts

Reactive Form
    They are dynamic forms means all the intractions, validtions are handled in component file (.ts)
    to reactive form we are using angular built in directives formGroup and formControl
    usally these forms are used for complex inputs or dynamic inputs
    we have import 'ReactiveFormModule' in app.module.ts

Steps to implement TDF
    Step 1: import FormsModule in app.module.ts
    Step 2: name form with # (template reference varibal) ngForm - angular directive
    Step 3: add ngModel in inputs (input text, email, password, textarea, checkbox, select option,...)
