Forms
    Forms are used to get some input from end user
    they be 
    register form
    login form
    contact
    forget password
    checkout form

    Forms are used to gathr some information and data from the end user
    It helps in intraction with the users

Types of Angular Forms
    1. Template Driven Form (TDF)
    2. Reactive Form (Dynamic Form)

With angular framework we can do with forms as
    two way data binding
    change tracking 
    validations
    error handling

TDF 
    they are easy to use and implement
    they are straightforward and simple
    the validations can be done or defined in template file (html)
    to use TDF we need to import 'FormsModule' in app.module.ts

Reactive Form
    They are dynamic forms means all the intractions, validtions are handled in component file (.ts)
    to reactive form we are using angular built in directives formGroup and formControl
    usally these forms are used for complex inputs or dynamic inputs
    we have import 'ReactiveFormModule' in app.module.ts

Steps to implement TDF
    Step 1: import FormsModule in app.module.ts
    Step 2: name form with # (template reference varibal) ngForm - angular directive
    Step 3: add ngModel in inputs (input text, email, password, textarea, checkbox, select option,...)
    
Reactive Form
    - for complex forms we are using reactive form in angular application
    - all the elements, validations and intractions can be handled in component file (.ts)
    - angulars built in 'formGroup' and 'formControl' to handle reactive form
    - two way data binding can be done smoothly in reactive form
    - to use reactive form, we need to import 'ReactiveFormsModule' in app.module.ts

States of reactive form
    - ng-touched
    - ng-dirty
    - ng-pristine
    - ng-valid
    - ng-invalid

Main things that we have to keep in mind about reactive form
    1. FormControl
    2. FormGroup
    3. FormBuilder

Steps to start with angular reactive form

    Step 1: Import 'ReactiveFormsModule' in app.module.ts (or any other module file where we want to use reactive form)
    Step 2: Create the form (.html)
        FormGroup
            it is directive from angular for assinging form name
        formControlName
            it can be add as an attribute for each field/input

    
FormBuilder
    - it is an abstraction layer which makes easy to design a reactive form
    - FormBuilder is used to make complex form structure
    - adding or removing form elements

    FormBuilder having 3 element
        1. FormGroup
        2. FormControl
        3. FormArray

Set Values in reactive form
    1. set values to entire form using FormControl('value')
    2. using setValue(valueObject) - we have to set all the formcontrols to set the values
    3. using patchValue(valueObject) - we can set any form control values

Validations in Reactive Form
    - we have built in form validators in reactive form
    - we have to write the validations in ts file i.e component file

Assignment - 
1. Create a forget password form using TDF (With Validations)
2. Create a student registration form using Reactive Form (With validations)
