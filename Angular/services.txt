DI - Dependency Injection
    - it is a desing pattern in application development
    - with the help di we are able supply data to the component
    - to get the data from di the component has to be Injectable service classe
    - angular provides its ows DI framework
    - with this we can increase the efficiency of an application

Servies
    - services allows us to create reusable common shared functioinality or data
    - services can be a singleton
    - services are injected into application using DI
    - commonly services used for HTTP requests to our endpoints (API Call)

Generate service in Angular CLI

    ng generate service serviceName

    ex. ng g service student
    
    For Local Services
    Step 1. Create Service File with CLI command
    Step 2. Create Methods or Functions that returns some data (shared data)
    Step 3. Import Service in component (where we want to get data from service)
    
HttpClient
    - HTTP requests are GET, POST, PUT, DELETE
    - HttpClient is used to perform HTTP requests and responses
    - HttpClient service is abaible in the @angular/common/http package
    - HttpClientModule needs to import in app module

    Steps to create http service
    Step 1: create a service fie with cli command
    step 2: import 'HttpClientModule in app.module.ts
    Step 3: import 'HttpClient' in service file or component for HTTP requests
    Step 4: Inject HttpClient in the constructor 
    Step 5: implement the HTTP Request call (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)

    GET Method
        - it is used to retriving data from server/ database
        - get('api-endpoints')
        - api-endpoints - 'url' - ex. http://exampl.com/api/getdata
