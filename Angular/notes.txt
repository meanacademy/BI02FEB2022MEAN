Angular:
    - Angular is a JavaScript framework that can be used to create Single Page Applications (SPA)
    - Angular supports of several components forming a tree structure with parent and child components
    - Angular is a development platform
    - Angular comes with CLI

Features of Angular

        npm install -g @angular/cli
    
    check your current install angular CLI version  
        ng --version
    
First App
    ng new applicationName
    ex: ng new myfirstapp

Run Angular Application
    ng s -o


Building Blocks of an Angular Application
    1. Component
        - contains intraction and logic for end user

        To create a component we can use command 
        ng generate component componentName
        or
        ng g c componentName

        ex. : ng generate component components/home

        This command will crete three building blocks of a component
        1. view or template file (.html)
        2. component/class file (.ts)
        3. Sytel file (.css or .scss)

        It will also update app module which is default module of a component

        2. Module (ngModule)
            ng generate module modulename
            or
            ng g m modulename

            ex. : ng g m modules/auth
                  ng g m auth
                  
                  ng g c modules/auth/login

Data Binding
    data binding is a technique where the data stays in sync between component (.ts) and the view (template or .html)

    Data Binding Types:
    1. One Way Data Binding
        in one way binding data flows form one direction
        either form component to view or view to component

        1.1 from component to view
            to bind data from component to view we can use
                interpolation - {{ templateExpression }}
                property Binding - [binding-target] = "binding-source"
                class binding - [class] or [ngClass]
                style binding - [style.color] or [ngStyle]
 
        1.2 from view to component
            to bind data from view to component we can use 
                event binding
                (target-event) = "templateStatement"
