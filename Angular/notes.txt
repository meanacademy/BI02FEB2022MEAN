Building Blocks of an Angular Application
    1. Component
        - contains intraction and logic for end user

        To create a component we can use command 
        ng generate component componentName
        or
        ng g c componentName

        ex. : ng generate component components/home

        This command will crete three building blocks of a component
        1. view or template file (.html)
        2. component/class file (.ts)
        3. Sytel file (.css or .scss)

        It will also update app module which is default module of a component

        2. Module (ngModule)
            ng generate module modulename
            or
            ng g m modulename

            ex. : ng g m modules/auth
                  ng g m auth
                  
                  ng g c modules/auth/login
        
        3. Directive
            Angular Directive helps us to manipulate DOM(Web Page).
            You can manage the appearance, behavior, layout of a DOM.
            You may add or remove the HTML element as per the requirements.

            Types of Directives
                1. Component Directive
                    These are the special directive in angular which cames with view or temolate(.html)

                2. Strutural Directive
                    Strutural directive can change the DOM layout by adding or removing DOM element. 
                    1. *ngFor
                        Syntax:
                        <element *ngFor="let <item> of <items>;">
                            <html-template></html-template>
                        </element>
                    2. *ngIf
                        Syntax:
                        <element *ngIf="condition">...</element>

                    3. *ngSwitch
                        Syntax:

                        <element [ngSwitch]="switch_expression">
                            <inner-element *ngSwitchCase="match_expression-1">....</inner-element>
                            <inner-element *ngSwitchCase="match_expression-2">....</inner-element>
                            <inner-element *ngSwitchCase="match_expression-3">....</inner-element>
                            <inner-element *ngSwitchDefault>....</inner-element>
                        </element>

                3. Attribute Directive
                    these directives are used to style the appearance of an element
                    1. ngStyle
                    2. ngClass
                    3. ngModel


Data Binding
    data binding is a technique where the data stays in sync between component (.ts) and the view (template or .html)

    Data Binding Types:
    1. One Way Data Binding
        in one way binding data flows form one direction
        either form component to view or view to component

        1.1 from component to view
            to bind data from component to view we can use
                interpolation - {{ templateExpression }}
                property Binding - [binding-target] = "binding-source"
                class binding - [class] or [ngClass]
                style binding - [style.color] or [ngStyle]
 
        1.2 from view to component
            to bind data from view to component we can use 
                event binding
                (target-event) = "templateStatement"
                
    2. Two Way Data Binding
        - the two way data binding means that changes made in template are propogated to the component and the changes made in component are immediately updated to template 
        - two way data binding [()] = property Binding [] + event binding ()
        syntax:
            <element [(propertyName)]="value"></element>
        - to use two way data binding we need to add or use angulars one of the directive - 'ngModel'
        - ngModel directive is used to get the property value
        - ngModelChange to get an event value
        - to use ngModel in HTML Form element we should import FormsModule in app.module.ts 

Angular Pipes:
    - Angular pipes takes data as an input and formats or transforms the data to display in template
    - Syntax:
        expression or data | pipeOperator[:options]
    
    uppercase
    lowercase
    currency
    date
    json

Angular Life Cycle Hooks:
    - Angular has 8 phases in its lifecycle

        constructor
        ngOnChanges
        ngOnInit
        ngDoCheck
            ngAfterContentInit
            ngAfterContentChecked
            ngAfterViewInit
            ngAfterViewChecked
        ngOnDestroy
