What is NoSQL?
    - it stands for not only sql or non sql
    - it dont have any structure for a database
    - they are not a tabular format

Types of NoSQL
    1. Document
        MongoDB, CouchDB, CosmosDB
    2. Key-Value
        Redis, DynamoDB
    3. Wide-Column
        Cassandra, HBase
    4. Graph
        Neo4j

SQL vs NoSQL
    - SQL dbs are relational dbs, NoSQL dbs are not relational dbs
    - SQL dbs are structured, NoSQL dbs are not structured
    - SQL dbs are having predefined schema for database, NoSQL dbs are schemaless, they are having dynamic schema
    - SQL dbs are vertically scalable, NoSQL dbs are horizontally scalable

Vertically Scalable
    scale by adding more 'power' (CPU, RAM, HDD) to an existing machine

Horizontally Scalable
    scale by adding more 'machine' into our pool of resources


What is MongoDB?
    - It is a NoSQL database which is written in C++.
    - It is Document oreiented database
    - built for modern web and mobile application development
    - it stores data in JSON like 'documents'

Setup
    go to website - https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community
    and download setup or zip file to your system
    procced with installtion process
    check if there is a service available for mongodb after installtion
    
    environment setup
        copy the mongodb bin path and set in environment varibals path

    
if you are a user of windows 7 - download mongodb v3.2 or less

MongoDB apps 
    1. mongod - mongodb server 
    2. mongo - mongodb client 

MongoDB Shell
    it is based on JS
    it uses MozJS-60 JS engine for the mongodb
    to check JS engine used in mongodb shell:  
        interpreterVersion();

Terminology: 
    SQL(MySQL)          MongoDB
    database            database
    table               collection
    record/row          document
    Col or Field        field
    indexing            indexing
    aggregation         aggregation

Data Types: 
    MongoDB stores the data in BSON type 
        BSON - Binary of JSON

    BSON Types or Data Types: 
        Types               Syntax
        string              ""
        int                 NumberInt()/NumberLong()
        Array               []
        boolean             true or false
        double              0.0
        object              {}
        date                ISODate()
        ObjectId            ObjectId()

_id:
    Mandatory Field from MongoDB document
    we can assign _id manually
    it will create automatically if you are not providing or assinging any value 
    if it is auto generated with mongodb, it has a value in ObjectId type

ObjectId:
    it is a default value of _id 
    ObjectId is a 12 byte in size
    it is a auto generated value

    the first 4 bytes are - timestamp
    the next 3 bytes are - machine identifier
    the next 2 bytes are - process id
    the next 3 bytes are - incremental counter
