Introduction:
    - Nodejs is not a framework nor programming language
    - Nodejs is runtime environment for Javascript
    - Nodejs is built with Chrome's V8 JavaScript Engine
    - Nodejs is an output of a c++ program which means the nodejs written in C++
    - C++ program also consists of V8 javascript engine so we are able to run js file out of the web browsers
    - Mostly Nodejs is used to create an APIs for web and mobile applications

Why?
    It is ideal for highly scalable applications
    It is aslo ideal for data intensive and real time applications
    It is superfast as compared to other programming language
    It creates cleaner code for backend
    we have large amount of open source lib

JavaScript Engine?
    - it is like a compiler who gets js file and converts into machine code

Node Modules
    Node Module Wrapper Function
    (function(exports, require, module, __filename, __dirname) {})

    Built in modules
        path
        url
        fs
        http
    Third Party Modules
        third party modules are the functioinality that can be implemented into our application
